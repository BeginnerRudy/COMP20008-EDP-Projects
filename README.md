# Identifying approaches to reduce avoidable death in Victoria

# Introduction
This is the personal project of COMP20008 Elements of Data Processing at semester 1 2018. In this projecy, I choose to analyze and identify the approaches to reduce the avoidable death in Victoria, Melboure. Finally, the data shows that there is correcltion between health factor and avoidable death, thus it might be a path for further investigation and research. 

# Overview
This project consists of 4 phases:
  -  Phase 1 is about some python data processing exercise, such as data selection, descriptino statisics, data visualization and so on.
  -  Phase 2: Concept formulation and preliminary investigation of the project topic.
  -  Phase 3: Finilizing data processing and writing a report about data analysing.
  -  Phase 4: Oral representation

# Usage
  - Package denpendency: pandas, matplotlib, datetime, sklearn, numpy, scipy, seaborn
  - Install Jupyter Notebook to run implementation in 
      - /phase1/notebook-for-answer.ipynb
      - /phase2/real project/avoidable_death_and_service_barrier/phase2_implementation.ipynb
      - /phase3/phase3 code/DataProcessing.ipynb

# Phase 3 Methodologies
  - Data Preprocessing
    - Data Formatting
    - Data Intergration
    - Handling Missing Value
    - Adding Values
    - Outlier Detection
  - Data Visualization and Analysing
    - Scatter Plot
    - Heat Map
    - Bar Chart
    - Pie Chart
    - VAT

# Conclusion
After data processing, I would say we can preventing avoidable death by reducing obese, lowexercise, risk waist measurement, psychological distress and smoking since there are positive correlations as well as encourage adequate fruit intake because of negative correlation. Furthermore, I would suggest the local government and people pay more attention to Northern Grampians (S) since there are many avoidable deaths as well as a high ratio.
