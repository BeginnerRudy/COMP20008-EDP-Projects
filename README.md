# Identifying approaches to reduce avoidable death in Victoria

# Introduction
This is the personal project of COMP20008 Elements of Data Processing at semester 1 2018. In this projecy, I choose to analyze and identify the approaches to reduce the avoidable death in Victoria, Melboure. Finally, the data shows that there is correcltion between health factor and avoidable death, thus it might be a path for further investigation and research. 

# Overview

  -  Phase 1 is about some python data processing exercise, such as data selection, descriptino statisics, data visualization and so on.
  -  Phase 2: Concept formulation and preliminary investigation of the project topic.
